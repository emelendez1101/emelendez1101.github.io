This is my home page! My name is Eduardo Melendez and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is computer science.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 2
    
    Lab 2, part 3 was one of my favorite labs because it was really my first introduction to actual programming. I took a computer science course in high school, and I would write code, but it was never in any real programming language such as C++. After learning the basics of GitHub and visual studio in parts 1 and 2, part 3 led through the tradition of getting “Hello World” to print on the terminal, which many new programmers go through.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was another of my favorite labs because it was one that I was stumped on for quite a long time and took a lot of effort to figure out. At the same time, this was one of the many blackjack games that I would have to work on, and I always enjoyed making simple games such as this one, even with how difficult they were. It was exhilarating when I finally figured out what was going wrong with my program, and it passed all the test cases.

* Lab 9 

    Lab 9, part 2 was another favorite of mine because it was one of the first labs in which we introduced external objects into our programs. In the case of this lab, we would take .txt files that we would treat as a glossary of words to check if the test cases had any misspelled words. Although I did not find it that difficult, the lab allowed me to develop another fundamental skill I would need in the future.
